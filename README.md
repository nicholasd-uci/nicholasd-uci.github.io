# Calculator App

### Worked on by Nicholas & Calum

> This app is a HTML + JS Cal, made for your math needs

We worked on this in class today, but we couldn't get the numbers to be integers and the came out as a strings. 

On this app, we utlized _Javescript_ to handle the operations and the logic behind the cal. The **HTML** was used to have the user interactive experience by providing buttons to handle the passing of data to the _Javescript_.
